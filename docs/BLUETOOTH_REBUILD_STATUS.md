# Bluetooth Module Rebuild Status

## Current Status: üî® **REBUILDING (Fixed Approach)**

The custom Bluetooth module has been successfully **configured and linked**, and is now building correctly.

## What's Happening Now

Running: `npx expo run:ios`
- ‚úÖ Ran `npx expo prebuild --clean` to regenerate proper codegen files
- ‚úÖ Re-added `RNLCBluetooth` pod to Podfile
- ‚úÖ Installed pod successfully: `RNLCBluetooth (1.0.0)`
- üî® Now compiling the native Swift code for `RNLCBluetoothModule`
- üî® Linking the `RNLCBluetooth` CocoaPod into the app
- üî® Creating fresh build with actual Bluetooth implementation

**Estimated Time**: 3-5 minutes

## Current Logs Show

‚ùå **Still seeing warnings** (expected until rebuild completes):
```
WARN  RNLCBluetoothModule not available. Event listener will not work.
WARN  RNLCBluetoothModule not found. Using mock implementation.
```

These warnings are **normal** because the app is still running the **old build** without the native module.

## After Rebuild Completes

‚úÖ **Expected behavior**:
- No warnings about `RNLCBluetoothModule`
- Real Bluetooth scanning discovers nearby devices
- BLE advertising broadcasts to other devices
- Device connections actually work

## Why This Happened

1. Pod was installed: ‚úÖ `RNLCBluetooth (1.0.0)` confirmed in `Podfile.lock`
2. But the app wasn't rebuilt with Xcode
3. Metro bundler restart alone doesn't include new native modules
4. **Solution**: Full clean build with Xcode

## Monitoring the Build

You can watch the build progress in the terminal. Look for:
- `Build Succeeded` - Ready to test!
- `Build Failed` - Check error messages

## Next Steps

1. Wait for build to complete
2. App will automatically launch in simulator
3. Test Bluetooth scanning - should find devices
4. Check logs - warnings should be gone

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `/react-native.config.js` - Autolinking config
- ‚úÖ `ios/Podfile` - Manual pod reference  
- ‚úÖ `ios/Podfile.lock` - Confirmed installation
- üî® `ios/build/` - Currently building...
