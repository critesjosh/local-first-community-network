- `.expo-commands.md` - Command reference cheat sheet
- `SETUP-COMPLETE.md` - This file

## How to Test on Your Physical Device

### FASTEST METHOD (Recommended for Beginners)

This takes less than 5 minutes and requires no building:

#### Step 1: Install Expo Go
- **Android**: Download "Expo Go" from Google Play Store
- **iOS**: Download "Expo Go" from Apple App Store

#### Step 2: Start Development Server
```bash
cd /home/josh/Documents/Github/local-social-network-expo
npm start
```

#### Step 3: Connect Your Device
**IMPORTANT**: Your phone and computer must be on the same WiFi network!

- **Android**: Open Expo Go app → Tap "Scan QR code" → Scan the QR code in terminal
- **iOS**: Open Camera app → Point at QR code → Tap notification → Opens in Expo Go

#### Step 4: Start Developing
- Edit `/home/josh/Documents/Github/local-social-network-expo/App.js`
- Save the file
- See changes instantly on your device
- Shake device to open developer menu

That's it! You're now developing on your physical device.

### If You Have Connection Issues

If your device can't connect to the development server:

```bash
# Try tunnel mode (slower but works across networks)
npm start -- --tunnel
```

## Available Commands

### Development Commands
```bash
npm start                 # Start development server (for Expo Go)
npm run start:dev-client  # Start for development builds
npm run android          # Launch on Android
npm run ios              # Launch on iOS
npm run web              # Launch in browser
```

### Building Commands (Advanced)
```bash
npm run prebuild          # Generate native Android/iOS projects
npm run prebuild:clean    # Clean and regenerate native projects
npm run build:android     # Build Android APK locally
npm run build:ios         # Build iOS app locally (macOS only)
```

## When to Use Each Method

### Use Expo Go When:
- Starting a new project
- Learning React Native
- Quick prototyping
- Don't need custom native modules
- Want fastest development cycle

### Use Development Builds When:
- Need custom native modules
- Building production app
- Need full native feature access
- Want complete control over native code

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Your Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /home/josh/Documents/Github/local-social-network-expo
npm start
```
Then connect with Expo Go on your phone.

### 2. Make Your First Change
Edit `/home/josh/Documents/Github/local-social-network-expo/App.js`:
```javascript
<Text>Hello from my Social Network App!</Text>
```
Save and watch it update on your device!

### 3. Start Building
- Add navigation: `npx expo install @react-navigation/native`
- Add UI components: `npm install react-native-paper`
- Add authentication: `npx expo install expo-auth-session`
- Add database: `npx expo install expo-sqlite`

### 4. Learn More
- Read `docs/QUICKSTART.md` for detailed quick start guide
- Read `docs/SETUP.md` for complete setup documentation
- Read `.expo-commands.md` for command reference
- Visit https://docs.expo.dev for full Expo documentation

## Prerequisites You Need

### Already Installed
- Node.js v22.16.0
- npm 10.9.2
- Git (initialized)

### Need to Install (Choose based on your method)

**For Expo Go Method** (Easiest):
- Just install Expo Go app on your phone
- No other requirements!

**For Local Building** (Advanced):
- **Android**: Android Studio, Android SDK, JDK 17+
- **iOS**: macOS with Xcode (iOS builds require Mac)
- **EAS CLI**: `npm install -g eas-cli`

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Device Can't Connect
```bash
# Try tunnel mode
npm start -- --tunnel
```

### App Shows Errors
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
npm start -- --clear
```

### Dependency Issues
```bash
# Reinstall everything
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clean native projects
npm run prebuild:clean
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need a Mac for iOS development?**
A: No! Use Expo Go for testing on iOS. You only need a Mac for building production iOS apps or development builds.

**Q: Can I test without a physical device?**
A: Yes! Use Android Emulator or iOS Simulator. Run `npm run android` or `npm run ios`.

**Q: Is my app limited with Expo?**
A: No! You can use any native module. For custom native code, create a development build.

**Q: Do I need to pay for Expo?**
A: No! Expo is free. EAS Build has free tier. Local building is completely free.

**Q: Can I eject from Expo later?**
A: With modern Expo, you don't need to eject. Use `expo prebuild` to access native code while staying in Expo.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Hot reload works (edit App.js and see changes)

## Your Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start development server
npm start

# 2. Connect device and test
# (Scan QR code with Expo Go)

# 3. Edit code
# Open App.js in your favorite editor

# 4. See changes instantly
# App reloads automatically on device
