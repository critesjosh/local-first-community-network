# Crypto Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was failing with `TypeError: c.getRandomValues is not a function (it is undefined)` because `@noble/ed25519` and `@noble/secp256k1` require the `crypto.getRandomValues()` function, which is not available in React Native by default.

## Solution
Installed and configured `react-native-get-random-values` to polyfill the `crypto.getRandomValues()` function for React Native. This package provides a synchronous, cryptographically secure random number generator that the `@noble` libraries require.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed react-native-get-random-values
```bash
npm install react-native-get-random-values
```

### 2. Added Polyfill Import to Entry Point
**File:** `index.js`
- Added `import 'react-native-get-random-values';` as the very first import
- This polyfills `crypto.getRandomValues()` globally before any crypto operations

### 3. Added Polyfill Import to Test Setup  
**File:** `__tests__/setup.ts`
- Added the same import to ensure tests work properly

### 2. Created Shared Crypto Configuration
**File:** `src/services/crypto/cryptoConfig.ts`
- Configures `@noble/ed25519` and `@noble/secp256k1` to use `expo-crypto`
- Must be imported before any crypto operations

### 3. Updated Crypto Services
- **KeyManager.ts**: Imports cryptoConfig, uses expo-crypto for key generation
- **ECDH.ts**: Imports cryptoConfig for ephemeral key generation
- **EncryptionService.ts**: Uses expo-crypto directly for random IV/key generation
  - Made `generateRandomKey()` and `generateIV()` async
  - Updated all callers to use `await`

### 4. Updated Test Setup
**File:** `__tests__/setup.ts`
- Added mock for `expo-crypto`
- Uses Node's `webcrypto` for crypto.subtle in tests

### 5. Database Fix
**File:** `src/services/storage/Database.ts`
- Fixed table creation to use single `execAsync()` call
- Added better error handling

### 6. Improved Error Messages
- **IdentityService.ts**: Added detailed logging at each step
- **OnboardingScreen.tsx**: Shows actual error messages

## Testing
Run tests to verify everything works:
```bash
npm test
```

## Running the App
Stop your current server and restart with a clean cache:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

If you're using a development build, you may need to rebuild the app since we added a new native dependency:
```bash
# For iOS
npx expo run:ios

# For Android  
npx expo run:android
```

Then try creating your identity again!
